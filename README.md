## About the project

Getting tickets from Kide.app is currently hard, since ticketscrapers are botting all the tickets.

This tool is more ethical, since it limits the reserved ticket and tries to beat the scrapers. 

This Reserver can be also used as a CLI to reserve tickets from kide.app.

NOTE:
Using this tool might violate kide.apps Terms of Service. I am not responsible, how you may use the tool.
